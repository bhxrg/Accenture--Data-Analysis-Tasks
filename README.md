Tasks:

**1.Analysis of Dataset:** We identified that Social Buzz needed a thorough analysis of their existing datasets to extract meaningful insights for growth and used 3 different datasets(ReactionTypes , Content ,
Reactions) csv files to analyse each seperately, how each variable affects the other , how does it play a role in analysing and the realtionships between the variables.

**2.Clean Data:** The data was inconsistent and required cleaning to remove inaccuracies like unecessary fields and variables, filtering null or blank values, renaming according to other datasets to find common 
variables and ensure reliability throughout the process. 

**3.Merging of Data:** Data from multiple sources had to be merged, creating a unified dataset to provide a comprehensive view of content performance, first considering the ReactionTypes and merge with Content csv
in excel using “VLookUp” formula and same for the other dataset.Creating new dataset after processing the dataset and treating missing values.

**Top 5 Categories of Content Analysis:** The primary challenge was to analyze this unified dataset to identify Social Buzz's top 5 most popular content categories, crucial for informing content strategy.
Figuring out the Top 5 performing categories by filter and data visualisation and Adding up the total scores for each category,using  the “Sum If” formula for the most popular category. 

**Final Analysis / Insights:**
1.Top 5 Performing Categories: Focus on creating more content in the top-performing categories as they drive the most engagement.
2.Reactions in the Most Popular Category: The most popular category has the highest engagement, so prioritize similar content to maintain interest.
3.Month with the Most Posts: The busiest month indicates a peak in audience activity; plan future content releases around this period.
4.Making presentation and presenting in a layman way to improve the skills of presentation, able to explain to people who dont have knowledge based on data analysis.
